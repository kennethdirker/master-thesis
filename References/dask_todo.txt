Step:
Generic process execution:
1.  Load input object.
2.  Load, process and validate a CWL document, yielding one or more process objects. The $namespaces present in the CWL document are also used when validating and processing the input object.
3.  If there are multiple process objects (due to $graph) and which process object to start with is not specified in the input object (via a cwl:tool entry) or by any other means (like a URL fragment) then choose the process with the id of "#main" or "main".
4.  Validate the input object against the inputs schema for the process.
5.  Validate process requirements are met.
6.  Perform any further setup required by the specific process type.
7.  Execute the process.
8.  Capture results of process execution into the output object.
9.  Validate the output object against the outputs schema for the process (with the exception of ExpressionTool outputs, which are always considered valid).
10. Report the output object to the process caller.
